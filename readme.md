## Project overview

It's my first time using Sinatra, and it's _so nice_. Last mod's "HTTP" project is more than enough to make me appreciate easy path parsing, html pages, and being able to see what text is POSTed to the URL.

Man. So nice.

as of 03/04/17 I've completed the first and last extension. Might add the final one later.
